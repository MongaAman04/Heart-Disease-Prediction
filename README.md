# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web Application

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-entered medical parameters. The frontend is developed using **React.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, while predictions are generated by a trained machine learning model accessed through an API.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early risk detection and awareness can significantly improve outcomes. This project aims to assist users in evaluating their heart health using data-driven predictions in an intuitive and user-friendly web interface.

## 🌟 Features

### 🔍 Prediction Engine
- Uses a **supervised machine learning model** trained on the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**.
- Accepts medical input parameters such as:
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
  - Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar, Max Heart Rate
  - ST Depression, Exercise-induced Angina
  - ECG Results, Number of Vessels, and more
- Provides real-time predictions on heart disease likelihood (binary classification).

### 🖥️ Frontend (React.js)
- Fully responsive interface using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Interactive form for entering patient data.
- Visual result display with health messages:
  - ✅ *"Your heart is healthy, keep it that way!"*
  - ⚠️ *"Possible heart issue, consult a doctor."*
- Heart health tips dynamically presented alongside predictions.

### 📡 Backend (Assumed - Flask or Node.js)
- REST API endpoint (`/submit`) for prediction.
- Accepts JSON data and returns prediction result.
- Integrates with a pickled `.pkl` model or serialized TensorFlow model.
